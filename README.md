# Chess

This is a project I've been working on in my freetime. I chose chess because I enjoy it quite a bit and have always wanted to make my own version.

I made this using JetBrains' CLion IDE. It was recommended to my by my boss at my internship because of how you can interact with CMake. I have grown quite attached to CLion because of it. Using CMake is very easy and much more readable then the settings in something like Visual Studio. 

I used SFML as the gui because it was the most beginner friendly. SFML is a really good library for beginners and I enjoyed using it. I used the 3.0.0 version. 

I used this repository to import SFML into my project. I suggest you try importing it yourself before you try with the repository however.
